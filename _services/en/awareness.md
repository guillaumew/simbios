The first step before considering the implementation of digital sobriety is to understand how digital practices impact the environment.

It involves understanding all the externalities of digital technologies (beyond their contribution to climate change) as well as knowing the magnitudes to understand what really has an impact.

- **Over-connected**: an improv show on sustainable IT
- **The Digital Collage**
- **The Battle of the Tech**
- **Digital reality**
