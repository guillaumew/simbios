## Prerequisites
Having conducted an [environmental assessment](/en/services/assessment)

This provides data on all the environmental impacts of the studied scope.

## Ideation Workshops

For the measures to be implemented and accepted within your company, it is ideal that they come from the people directly involved.

Therefore, we propose holding participatory workshops so that everyone can suggest measures or ideas to reduce the environmental footprint.

These ideas are then discussed to retain those that make the most sense.

## Cost of Measures

The difficulty and cost of implementing these measures are then quantified to determine if they can be applied quickly.

Difficulty may arise from resistance to change or from a loss of comfort within the teams.
The cost may be financial or in terms of resources required to implement the measure (typically, development work) or even in potential loss of revenue.
The cost and difficulty are assessed by your teams.

## Environmental Contribution of the Measures

Based on the Life Cycle Analysis, Simbios will estimate the potential environmental impact reduction for each measure.


## Decision-Making and Planning

All these measures are then discussed to decide on their priorities. It is decided who will implement them, with what resources, and within what deadlines, in an action plan. We also formalize success criteria to assess the effectiveness of the measure and its application.

## Implementation of the Action Plan

For the actual work, we move on to the next step.
