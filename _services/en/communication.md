## Internal Communication

It is important to be fully transparent about your approach with your colleagues. The decisions made to reduce environmental impact may be perceived as a deterioration in working conditions or may trigger eco-anxiety.

Everyone's efforts are expected and can be a source of fulfillment at work if the goals are shared by all those involved.

It is also important to remain attentive to the kindness of discussions on these topics, which can sometimes be divisive.

## External Communication

Communicating about your approach with your clients, prospects, users, or other partners is an incredibly complex task. Even the most skilled companies in communication have faced challenges.

However, environmental improvements can and should be highlighted. This can be achieved by describing the effort made, staying humble about the results, and showcasing future ambitions.
