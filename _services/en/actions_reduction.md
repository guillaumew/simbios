## Action Plan in Hand

After a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), we have established an action plan to reduce the environmental footprint. We ensure the follow-up of this action plan, but we can also intervene directly on several points.

## Eco-Design of Services

When creating your service or product, itâ€™s important to consider its environmental impact. We can support you in the eco-design process, whether for the creation of a service or for a product used by millions of users. We will follow the referenced best practices:

- General Reference Framework for the Eco-design of Digital Services (RGESN) proposed by the interministerial mission "Eco-responsible Digital."
- The 115 best practices for responsible design of digital services by the GreenIT collective.

This ensures that your service offers the best while minimizing its environmental impact.

## Website Optimization

Having a website to promote your services and products is essential. But often, these websites are created without considering their environmental impact.

Do you know where your website stands? I invite you to test it yourself directly on the {% include link.html text="Eco-Index website from GreenIT" link="https://www.ecoindex.fr/" external=true %}.

A showcase site should ideally reach an Eco-Index A. If youâ€™re below that, feel free to contact us to discuss it further.


## Reducing Cloud Usage

This is an interesting area where environmental efforts can also lead to financial savings. Indeed, some well-thought-out configurations can reduce both the bill and the environmental impact:

- Implementing autoscaling
- Adjusting server size based on actual demand
- Shutting down non-production environments at night
- Changing server locations
- Revising backup policies

## Agile Coaching

To improve the effectiveness of technical teams, we can organize agile coaching. The idea is to guide teams through agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, or SAFe.

- Stimulating collaboration
- Increasing operational efficiency
- Fostering a culture of continuous improvement

## Project Manager

The role of a project manager is crucial in integrating sustainability and environmental responsibility into the development process of a product or service.

They are responsible for planning, coordinating, and implementing projects while ensuring that the best eco-design practices are applied at each stage. This helps create sustainable solutions that meet needs while preserving the environment.
